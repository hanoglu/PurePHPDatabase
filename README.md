# PurePHPDatabase
## About
PurePHPDatabase is a very minimal database written to use on the limited accessed server.<br>
PurePHPDatabase does not use any other binary or script file other than PHP! It designed to communicate with using limited accessed server like the servers in univerities which you only can run PHP to make your own university webpage. It coordinates simultaneous user inputs by putting clients in order using file system of local host. By nature it takes many time compared the other database servers but using file system or sparated progress is only way to handle simultaneous clients in PHP(as far as I know).
